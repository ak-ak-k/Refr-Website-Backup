                            Payment”) from the User’s REFR Wallet. Should the User have insufficient balance in his/her
                            REFR
                            Wallet in order to facilitate such redemption of the Invalidated Payment, the User shall

                            business days from the date of receiving a written notice from REFR, remit the Invalidated

                            into REFR’s bank account, details of which shall be set out in the notice. If the User fails
                            to remit the
                            Invalidated Payment into REFR’s bank account despite having received the notice, REFR shall
                            be
                            entitled to initiate civil and/or criminal legal action against the defaulting User at

                            3.11. REFR Wallet: The ‘REFR Wallet’ payment option is a closed loop prepaid payment
                            instrument
                            provided by REFR in order to facilitate the payment for purchase of Products or Services
                            available on its
                            own platform. REFR Cash is the in-app currency, which is stored in the REFR Wallet. All
                            businesses
                            enlisted on the REFR platform accept payments &amp; reward cashbacks to the users on the
                            platform in the
                            form of REFR Cash. REFR Cash cannot be withdrawn from the REFR Wallet into the user’s bank
                            account.

                            If a User cancels an order for which payment has already been made to REFR, the User shall
                            have an
                            option to credit the monies paid towards the order into his/her REFR Wallet. The balance
                            lying in a User’s
                            REFR
                            Wallet can be used by such User for future purchases only on the REFR Platform, and will not
                            be
                            refunded back to the User unless permitted under applicable laws. In the eventuality of a
                            User wishing
                            to deactivate his/her account with REFR, the User agrees that all monies lying in the User’s
                            REFR Wallet,
                            if any, will automatically stand forfeited, and REFR will not be required to process any
                            refunds in any
                            manner whatsoever. The User therefore agrees to use and exhaust any balance in his/her REFR
                            Wallet prior to requesting
                            for a deactivation of his/her account on the Platform. Notwithstanding anything to
                            the contrary, any refund of store credit to customers will be at the sole discretion of
                            REFR. If REFR
                            suspects any fraudulent activities, REFR reserves its right to hold back transfer of any
                            store credits to
                            customers.

                            Users’ REFR Wallets
                            pursuant to discounts offered by it or specified third parties as a part of various
                            promotional events

                            the time of such promotions. Such promotions may be structured in any manner as may be
                            decided by
                            REFR in its sole discretion. For example, the accounts of the Users may be credited with
                            virtual
                            points/cash based on the terms and conditions of various promotions, and a specified number
                            of such
                            points/coins may translate into discounts offered to the Users (by way of credit of monies
                            into the
                            Users’ REFR Wallets) at certain specified/pre-determined events. However, this virtual
                            points/cash can
                            only be used within the Refr app by the user.
